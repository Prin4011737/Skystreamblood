    <!-- In-Depth Patient Education & Health Tips -->
    <h2>Understanding Your Blood Tests: A Complete Guide</h2>
    <p>Blood tests are crucial diagnostic tools that help detect health issues early, monitor ongoing conditions, and guide treatment plans. Here’s an in-depth look at some of the most common tests we offer:</p>
    <h3>Complete Blood Count (CBC)</h3>
    <p>The CBC measures various components of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. It helps diagnose anemia, infections, clotting disorders, and certain blood cancers.</p>
    <p>Normal ranges vary, but any deviation can indicate underlying health issues. For example, low hemoglobin suggests anemia, while high white blood cell counts point to infections or inflammation.</p>
    <h3>Blood Sugar Tests</h3>
    <p>Blood sugar testing is essential for diagnosing and managing diabetes. Fasting blood sugar, postprandial (after meal), and HbA1c levels give a comprehensive picture of your blood glucose control over time.</p>
    <p>Maintaining blood sugar within normal ranges reduces the risk of complications like neuropathy, kidney damage, and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
    <h3>Lipid Profile</h3>
    <p>The lipid profile includes total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. Elevated LDL and triglycerides increase heart disease risk, while higher HDL is protective.</p>
    <p>Regular monitoring helps in early intervention through lifestyle changes and medications.</p>
    <h3>Thyroid Function Tests</h3>
    <p>TSH, T3, T4, and Free T4 levels assess thyroid health. Abnormalities can lead to symptoms like weight changes, fatigue, mood swings, or metabolic disturbances.</p>
    <h3>Liver & Kidney Function Tests</h3>
    <p>These tests evaluate the health of vital organs. Abnormal liver enzymes or bilirubin indicate liver issues, while elevated creatinine and urea suggest kidney problems.</p>
    <h3>Vitamin & Hormone Tests</h3>
    <p>Assess micronutrient deficiencies or hormonal imbalances that can affect overall health, mood, energy, and metabolic processes.</p>
    <h3>Infectious Disease Testing</h3>
    <p>Screening for HIV, hepatitis, dengue, malaria, and other infections is vital for early diagnosis and treatment, preventing disease spread.</p>
    <h3>Autoimmune & Cancer Markers</h3>
    <p>Detect autoimmune disorders and early signs of cancer, enabling timely intervention and better prognosis.</p>
